# Pyles
A very simple file manager written in Python that uses Qt6.

# Setup
On linux, make sure to `chmod +x` Pyles!
<br>On Windows, click '<ins>More Info</ins>' and then '**Run anyway**' if you get the "Windows protected your PC" popup!

<br>**Note**:
<br>I've recently tested on Linux Mint 22 and found that I can only open Pyles with a terminal window. A `.desktop` file has to launch with a terminal window too or else Pyles won't run!
